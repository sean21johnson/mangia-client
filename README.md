**Mangia** was created to help people store memories of their favorite meals. "A picture is worth 1000 words", said some smart photog a long time ago. The Mangia UI is centered around this insightful mantra. Front & center are pictures of all the meals in a user's collection. Click on the picture of any meal in your collection for additional meal details. Update meal details or delete a meal from your collection at any time. To quickly find a memory, utilize the Mangia search bar or meal category filter.
